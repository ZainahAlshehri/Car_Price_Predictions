# Car_Price_Predictions - Proposal  
# Overview:
The goal of this project is that we are going to build a linear regression model that predicts the prices of the cars based on the features. using the data from the Kaggle website . We will do a comprehensive analysis with all data cleaning, exploration, visualization, feature selection, model building, and evaluation.

# Tools:
*	Pandas and NumPy packages to manipulate data. 
*	Matplotlib library for visualizing data. 
	LinearRegression from the sklearn.linear_model class of the sklearn module, to perform the linear regression then predicted the price. 
•	mean_absolute_error from the sklearn.metrics module to measure the accuracy of the model. 
•	Jupyter notebook to execute the code.
